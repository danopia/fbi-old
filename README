FBI Version Control Informant
==============================================

FBI is, at the core, a code-oriented message relay. It is what you would
get when you cross XMPP with IRC, except with JSON instead of XML. The
relay server allows components to connect, auth, subscribe to channels,
and publish to channels or to named components.

I'm not getting into the protocol here; that belongs elsewhere.

FBI has a few different categories of components. There are input
components, which bring data into the system; output components, which
bring data out of the system; and IRC components, which basically just
communicate with the IRC output component to provide IRC commands.

Contents
-------

out/ - Contains the output components. The big one here is IRC. Please
       note that the IRC module will not run until you migrate the DB
       tables, so run a quick `ruby irc_migrate.rb` before you run
       irc.rb. You'll have to remigrate if I change the schemas later.

in/  - Contains the input components. The big one here is UDP. The UDP
       component receives messages from a UDP socket on port 1337 and
       publishes what it receives to the "irc" channel. The web-app uses
       this (but soon it will either connect personally or just forward
       what it gets to a GitHub component for processing).
       
       Important note here: The (non-working) email one wants you to
       pipe in an email stream. On unix-y systems, this would involve
       something like `tail -n 0 -f /var/mail/fbi | ruby email.rb`.

www/ - A rails app that is used to receive webhooks from github. Soon to
       be replaced by a PHP file for RAM reasons. Depends on the 'udp'
       in component to fully work.

server.rb - The FBI message relay hub. Uses a custom JSON protocol.
            Listens on TCP port 5348. Binds to localhost by default as
            of the writing of this sentence (to be changed to 0.0.0.0).
            
            Everything relies on this.

common/ - Shared classes for all the FBI components to use. Contains
          goodies for EventMachine and some other misc stuff.
