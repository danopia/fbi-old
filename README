FBI Version Control Informant
==============================================

This code depends on an IRCd running at localhost:6667. It uses Scott's on_irc library for clients.

out/ - The different methods/bots that take info out of the system. These bots commonly have a nick that starts with "out_". The most important bot here will eventually be the IRC one.

in/ - The different methods/bots that bring info in to the system. These bots commonly have a nick that starts with "in_". Important note here: The email one wants you to pipe in an email stream. On unix-y systems, this would involve something like `tail -n 0 -f /var/mail/fbi | ruby bot.rb`.

on_irc/ - on_irc library.

server/ - A special server just for FBI message hubbing. Current GServer's source :)

common/ - Shared classes for all the FBI bots to use. These are used for the JSON parsing and other cool stuff.
